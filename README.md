To see the shader, clone the repository, and open the Unity project.
A scene is created with 2 Objects, a sphere and cube. They already have the shader on them. 
The shader code is called OutlineShader, a material called OutlineMaterial already has the shader applied, on this material you can change different parameters to get the look you prefer.
